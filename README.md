# DCSA JIT - Just In Time (Port Call optimization)

Building and Running the project,
-------------------------------------
**[RECOMMENDED]**
Setup a Github Personal Access Token as mentioned [here](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-Core/blob/master/README.md#how-to-use-dcsa-core-packages), then skip to **step 3**.

If you would like to build required DCSA packages individually, begin with step 1.

1) Build **DCSA-Core** as described in [DCSA-Core/README.md](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-Core/blob/master/README.md#to-build-manually-run), then

2) Build **DCSA-Event-Core** as described in [DCSA-Event-Core/README.md](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-Event-Core/blob/master/README.md#to-build-manually-run), then

3) Clone **DCSA-JIT** (with ``--recurse-submodules`` option.) and Build using, ``mvn package``

4) Initialize your local postgresql database as described in [datamodel/README.md](https://github.com/dcsaorg/DCSA-Information-Model/blob/master/README.md) \
   or If you have docker installed, you may skip this step and use the docker-compose command mentioned below to set it up (This will initialize the application along with the database).

5) Run application,
```
mvn spring-boot:run [options]

options:
 -Dspring-boot.run.arguments="--DB_HOSTNAME=localhost:5432 --LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG"
 ```

OR using **docker-compose**

```
docker-compose up -d -V --build
```

6) Verify if the application is running,
```
curl http://localhost:9090/v2/actuator/health
```
